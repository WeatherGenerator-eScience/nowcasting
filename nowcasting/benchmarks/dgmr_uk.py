class DGMRModel:
    """
    A wrapper class for loading and running the DeepMind Generative Model of Radar (DGMR)
    for precipitation nowcasting.

    This class facilitates using a pre-trained TensorFlow SavedModel of DGMR within
    a larger evaluation or prediction framework. It handles model loading, input
    preparation (including transformations and noise generation for stochastic forecasts),
    and output processing.

    Original Model Source:
    - Google DeepMind Research: https://github.com/google-deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/nowcasting

    Adaptation Source:
    - MeteoSwiss ldcast repository: https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/ldcast
      (Specifically, inspired by or derived from `eval_dgmr.py` in that project)

        Generates a nowcast prediction for a batch of input radar data using DGMR.

        This method allows the DGMRModel instance to be called directly like a function.
        It preprocesses the input, generates latent noise, feeds data to the DGMR
        model, extracts the forecast, and post-processes the output.

        Parameters:
            x : The input radar data. Expected to be a batch, potentially as a list,
                tuple, or NumPy array. The internal logic handles converting to
                NumPy and transposing to the format DGMR expects.
                Assumed input shape: (Batch, Channels, Time_in, Height, Width).

            y : The target data (passed through unchanged, as DGMR is an autoregressive
                generative model and doesn't use `y` for its forward pass).
